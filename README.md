Tehila
======
A 3d engine written in scheme.

Currently Tehila is alpha-quality, and very [Chicken Scheme](http://chicken.wiki.br/) specific.

Dependencies
------------
I may be missing some requirements. I will install on a secondary machine and document to ensure this is accurate. That said, it should be right.

You'll need the following [eggs](http://chicken.wiki.br/eggs):

[opengl](http://chicken.wiki.br/opengl)
[glut](http://chicken.wiki.br/eggref/4/glut)

And the following extensions (don't worry, **they should be included by default**):
lolevel
[srfi-1](http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/srfi-1.html)
[srfi-4](http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-4/srfi-4.html)

Usage
------------
Check out the examples directory, or "csi launcher.scm"

Beware that you will need the bitmap (bmp) files in resources/ currently. They're not there. Another day, perhaps.
